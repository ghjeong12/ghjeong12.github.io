For this winter, I will be working on image captioning.

### To do list

* Paper 1
  * Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering
  * Motivation
    * While top-down visual attention mechanisms are used widely in image cationing and VQA, bottom-up mechanisms were not that famous. 
    * The bottom-up mechanism (based on Faster R-CNN) will be able to provide more various image regions.
* Paper 2
  * Recurrent fusion network for image captioning

* Reference source code
  * <a href="https://github.com/ruotianluo/self-critical.pytorch">Code</a> 
  * From ./model/Attmodel.py, check how topdown core class and attention class work.
