From this semester, I am starting my PhD of Computer Science studies at Georgia Tech majoring in computer architecture.

I will be taking CS6290, High Performance Computer Architecture.
With the lecture, I will also watch some videos from the computer architecture course taught by Onur Mutlu, ETH Zurich. The lectures are available at [Lectures](https://safari.ethz.ch/architecture/fall2018).
