title: TED talk-An astronaut's story of curiosity, perspective and change | Leland Melvin
---

The TED talk, An astronaut's story of curiosity, perspective and change, Leland Melvin, is available at [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McxUiTl61nY).  

I believe there are a lot of perspectives in the world, and it may not be possible to know all of them. What kinds of perpectives that I should have, or what kinds of perspectives are right(wrong)?  

At least, it is trivial that to know more perspectives in the world, you need experience more beside what you are already familiar with.
